# Welcome!


## Who's this documentation for?

<a href="playanalyzer.com">PlayAnalyzer.com</a> is built on top of a RESTful server that processes PML and produces metadata and visualization outputs. While most users can gain insight into a play through the web interface, this documentation exposes the full API for users who want to be able to quickly batch generate insights and analyses of plays.

## How to get started

Most users should use the play analyzer <a href="https://github.com/kevinmkarol/playAnalyzer_client_scripts">cleint scripts</a> repository to make requests to the server using python.  Just replace the file path parameter and start generating outputs with single python commands.

If you haven't had a chance to mark up your own texts into PML yet, but would like to see what this API can do, a <a href="https://github.com/kevinmkarol/playAnalyzer_play_repository">play repository</a> of public domain texts is also available.

## Site Map
The site pages document the following information:<br>
<b>PML Spec:</b> Documents Play Markup Language (PML) syntax and design philosophy<br>
<b>Metadata API:</b> Documents metadata outputs available and the return JSON syntax<br>
<b>Visualization API:</b> Documents requests for play visualizations to generate pngs<br>

## Making API Requests
All requests are POST requests to api.playAnalyzer.com/api_type.  

All API requests require the following fields:<br>
<b>pml_text</b> - the marked up play text as a file<br>
<b>type</b> - the output type to generate<br>
